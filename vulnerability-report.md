# A1 - Injection
## How you found and exploited the vulnerability, including the code/method you used?
- Uploading an image with sql in the file name allowed us to create an image that when clicked
exposes the hashed username and password in the Django error message.  The exact sql is:
    - testPic',(select password from auth_user where username='admin'),7);--

## What you were able to do with the vulnerability (i.e. what was exposed?)
- We were able to see the hashed password and username for the user with the error message, not that much else was revealed.

## The code that fixes the vulnerability
- Creating the file with defined values and saving the file would prevent sql injection, instead of directly executing the code to the database.


# A2 - Broken Auth
## How you found and exploited the vulnerability, including the code/method you used
- On the user creation form we added checkboxes for is_admin, is_staff, is_superuser.
    <input type="checkbox" value="is_admin" id="is_admin">
    <input type="checkbox" value="is_staff" id="is_staff">
    <input type="checkbox" value="is_superuser" id="is_superuser">

## What you were able to do with the vulnerability (i.e. what was exposed?)
- We were able to log into the admin site. Which is not good.

## The code that fixes the vulnerability
- We restricted the fields of the form to only modifiable categories we would want the user to hsve access to:
    fields = ['username', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'email', 'password']


# A3 - XSS
## How you found and exploited the vulnerability, including the code/method you used
- We edited the username to have an alert popup where the username would be loaded by inserting a script as the username to run.  The code used is:
<script>alert('This worked as a hack.')</script>


## What you were able to do with the vulnerability (i.e. what was exposed?)
- We were able to run a script that would run each time a username aspect was run.   This would be more malicious with a vicous script rather then an alert saying there was a hack.


## The code that fixes the vulnerability
- We removed the '|safe' in the templates, so the tags would be removed and we do not presume that the username is safe to display.  


# A4 - Insecure DOR
## How you found and exploited the vulnerability, including the code/method you used
- We could change the url and it would open up the other user's projects from a user that should not have access.  By writing this:
    - http://127.0.0.1:8000/taskManager/7/task_edit/14  We were able to edit another user's project.  This is from user 8's account.


## What you were able to do with the vulnerability (i.e. what was exposed?)
- We were able to see the projects for any user.  We were also able to delete said projects of another user from a different account.
    - http://127.0.0.1:8000/taskManager/7/task_delete/14  This is once again from user 8's account.  

## The code that fixes the vulnerability
- If we go through the views and apply the user.is_authenticated() if statement we will be able to block editing sites where it does not belong to the user that is logged in.  Although really ths site needs a lot more help then that to lock this down.  We now use that on the majority of views and redirect them back to the login page.
